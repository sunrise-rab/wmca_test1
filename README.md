## Introduction

Hi students! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to your **Mini JavaScript Project**! This is a great opportunity for you to test and challenge your knowledge of JavaScript. In this project, you'll be building the functionality for a webpage using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS files are already provided, so your task is to focus solely on **adding JavaScript** to bring the website to life.

## Project Overview

Once you open the live link, youâ€™ll see a **list of tasks** that you need to complete. These tasks are designed to help you practice various JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation.

### Key Details:
- **Tasks are independent of each other** â€” you can tackle them in any order.
- Each task will test different aspects of JavaScript functionality, so make sure to approach them step-by-step.
- Use the provided HTML and CSS as the foundation, but youâ€™ll need to **add JavaScript** to make the page interactive and functional.

## What Youâ€™ll practice:
- **DOM Manipulation:** How to interact with and update HTML elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** How to handle user interactions like clicks, typing, etc.



## Tips for Success:
- **Start simple:** Focus on one task at a time. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t get everything perfect on the first try.
- **Test often:** As you add JavaScript, test the functionality in the browser to make sure everything works as expected.
- **Use the browser console:** If you run into issues, open the **Developer Tools** (press `F12` in most browsers) and check the **Console** for errors or logs.
- **Practice makes perfect:** If youâ€™re stuck, review the JavaScript concepts weâ€™ve covered in class or refer to the documentation.
